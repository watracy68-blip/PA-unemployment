Project Overview： the goal of this project is to give students an opportunity to apply the time-series methods
learned in class to a real-world setting. Students will analyze the time series of the
unemployment rate of one of the 50 U.S. states over the past thirty years (July 1995 to June
2025). Students may choose the state they wish to analyze for the project. However,
students will not be able to pick a state that is very similar to one chosen by another
student (decided on a first-come first-serve basis).
